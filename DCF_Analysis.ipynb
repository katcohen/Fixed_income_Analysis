    "Implications & Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "Valuation: At a 4.50% required return, 119.73 is fair value. If the market price is below this level, the bond is undervalued (positive NPV at 4.5%); above it, overvalued versus your hurdle rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Risk Posture: With moderate duration ~3.38y, rate risk is moderate. For mandate-level duration targeting, hedge or add duration accordingly using the DV01 to scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "Carry vs. price risk: This is a carry-rich position (10% coupon) whose premium will pull down toward par. In a bearish rates view, consider trimming exposure or overlaying a modest short-duration hedge to reduce steepening/parallel-shift sensitivity by the desired number of bp*DV01. In a bullish view, maintaining exposure captures convexity-aided upside.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reinvestment & conventions: This result assumes annual compounding, no taxes/fees, and reinvestment at the discount rate. For production use, align frequency (e.g., semiannual), day-count, and accrued-interest handling with market conventions to avoid small but persistent biases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reproducibility (key figures)\n",
    "\n",
    "Price: 119.7314\n",
    "\n",
    "PV(coupons)/PV(principal): 35.8753 / 83.8561\n",

    "Macaulay / Modified duration: 3.5341 / 3.3819\n",

# Executive Summary — Yield Curve & Portfolio Positioning

- **Curve shape:** Front end remains inverted; curve slopes upward at longer maturities  
  (≈5.3% at 3M → 4.35% at 10Y → 4.60% at 30Y).  

- **Portfolio impact:** 3–7Y bonds benefit from roll-down; long-end exposure adds risk if steepening occurs.  

- **Key risk metrics:** Portfolio duration ≈4.5 years, with concentration in the 10Y sector.  
  - Bear steepener: –3.3% portfolio value  
  - Bull flattener: +1.9% portfolio value  

- **Positioning if curve steepens:** Trim 10Y exposure or hedge with futures; keep duration near 4.5 years.  

- **Positioning if curve flattens/rallies:** Keep intermediate core, selectively add 10Y exposure to increase convexity and upside capture.  


# Yield Curve and Portfolio Positioning

The yield curve is still inverted at the very front end but gradually moves higher at longer maturities  
(about **5.3% at 3 months**, **4.35% at 10 years**, and **4.60% at 30 years**).  
This favors the intermediate part of the curve, since bonds in the 3–7 year range benefit as they roll down into lower yields.  
The long end, by contrast, offers less carry and is more vulnerable if the curve steepens.

## Bond and Portfolio Metrics

- **5-year 4.5% benchmark bond**  
  - Price: ~100.66 (just above par)  
  - Modified duration: ~4.4 years  
  - Price sensitivity: ~0.44% per 10 bp yield move (before convexity)  

- **Three-bond portfolio**  
  - Aggregate duration: ~4.5 years  
  - Risk concentration: 10-year area  
  - Stress tests:  
    - Bear steepener (+25 bps in 2s, +100 bps in 10s) → **–3.3%** portfolio value  
    - Bull flattener (–75 bps in 2s, –25 bps in 10s) → **+1.9%** portfolio value

## Positioning Implications

- **If curve steepens further:**  
  - Reduce 10-year exposure or hedge with futures  
  - Maintain overall duration near 4.5 years  

- **If disinflationary rally / flattening:**  
  - Keep intermediate core (3–7 year sector)  
  - Add measured 10-year exposure to increase convexity and upside capture

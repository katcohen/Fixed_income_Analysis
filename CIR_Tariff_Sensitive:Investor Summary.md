### Rates Outlook — Investor Summary

- **Baseline:** Rates hover ~3.25–3.50% with mild tariff effects.  
- **Tariff escalation:** More persistent inflation, higher volatility at the front end.  
- **De-escalation / slowdown:** Rates drift lower (~2.75%) with faster normalization.

**Portfolio stance**
- Keep duration below benchmark, focused in 2–7 years.  
- Add TIPS / breakevens for inflation protection.  
- Tilt toward IG and loans; reduce high yield.  

**If tensions ease:** extend duration and add credit spreads on weakness.  

**Risk guardrails:**  
- DV01 within ±10% of benchmark  
- HY at or below benchmark in escalation  
- ≥5% liquidity sleeve
